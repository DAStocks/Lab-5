	<h1><center>Lithium the new oil</center></h1>

	<p> Lithium is never found in its elemental, metallic form because it is highly reactive: lithium is highly flammable, and will even react spontaneously with water. (This high reactivity is why some lithium-ion batteries ignite or explode when exposed to high temperatures.) Instead, lithium is usually extracted from lithium minerals that can be found in igneous rocks (chiefly spodumene) and from lithium chloride salts that can be found in brine pools. The largest producer of lithium in the world is Chile, which extracts it from brine at the Atacama Salt Flat. Argentina also produces lithium from brine at the Hombre Muerto Salt Flat. There is also an enormous lithium deposit in Bolivia at the Uyuni Salt Flat (the world's largest salt flat), but this resource remains untapped for now due to political and economic reasons. The largest producer of lithium from spodumene is Australia, which has a large deposit near Perth. Other major lithium producers include China, which produces it at salt lakes in Tibet and Qinghai, and the United States, which produces it from brine in Nevada. Extracting lithium from brine is currently cheaper than mining it from spodumene, so there are many deposits of spodumene that are not currently being mined. Lithium is also present in seawater, but the concentration is too low to be economic. </p>

<p> Currently there is only a single Lithium mine in the United States at the Silver Peak mine in Nevada. It isn't a large producer in coparison to other countries.</p>

  <p> If Tesla wanted to produce 500,000 cars per year it would require the world's entire lithium supply. In 2014, Tesla (and Panasonic) began production of Gigafactory. All within threeo lithium used by Tesla, therefore Tesla the majority of their lithium from Chile.</p>
